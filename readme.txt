I started by building the HTML and CSS, as they form the foundation of the program. 
I saved the JavaScript for last because implementing the logic for adding, deleting, and marking tasks was 
the most challenging part. To overcome this, I did extensive research on Google and used several AI tools to help me understand and 
implement the necessary functionality.

I completed the task in 3 hours. Although the development part was manageable, 
I encountered a delay because I had forgotten how to deploy the project on GitHub. 
I had to take some time to recall the process and relearn the necessary steps to complete the deployment.
